Welcome to Apache ServiceMix 4 
==============================
Apache ServiceMix is a flexible, open-source integration container that unifies 
the features and functionality of Apache ActiveMQ, Camel, CXF, and Karaf 
into a powerful runtime platform you can use to build your own integrations solutions. 
It provides a complete, enterprise ready ESB exclusively powered by OSGi.

It is being released under Apache License.

The main features are:
- reliable messaging with Apache ActiveMQ
- messaging, routing and Enterprise Integration Patterns with Apache Camel
- WS-* and RESTful web services with Apache CXF
- OSGi-based server runtime powered by Apache Karaf

Other, optional features:
- loosely coupled integration between all the other components with 
    Apache ServiceMix NMR including rich Event, Messaging and Audit API
