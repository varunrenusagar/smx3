                      Apache ServiceMix 4.3.0
                  ================================
 Overview
 --------

Apache ServiceMix 4.3.0 is a major release of the OSGi based ServiceMix ESB platform.  This release contains many
bugfixes and feature enhancements over the 4.2.0 release.  ServiceMix 4.3.0 includes the following dependencies:

- Apache Felix Karaf 2.1.3 (http://karaf.apache.org)
  A lightweight OSGi container built on top of Apache Felix OSGi framework.  Karaf provides much of the core OSGi
  functionality and features (SSH shell, console commands, provisioning, blueprint XML support, etc...)

- Apache ServiceMix NMR 1.4.0
  An OSGi based NMR and JBI container, with a new clustering engine ready for enterprise deployment

- Apache ServiceMix Components 2011.01
  OSGi and JBI compatible components for common integration bindings such as FTP, HTTP, JMS, etc. as well as
  service engines such as Camel (Enterprise Integration Patterns), Quartz, JSR-223 Scripting, etc.

ServiceMix 4.3.0 also ships with a web console for administering and deploying endpoints and components,
additional OSGi bundles, and configuration files.  We also include support for running outof the box web applications
via WAR file deployment.  This release includes preliminary implementations of the OSGi Enterprise Specification 4.2
and includes support for OSGi fragment bundles.  OSGi framework support defauls to Apache Felix, but can be changed
via a simple configuration paramater to use Eclipse Equinox.

 Java 1.5.0 support
 ------------------
To be able to run ServiceMix 4.3.0 using Java 1.5.0, you need to remove jaxp-ri-1.4.4.jar from the lib/endorsed folder.
