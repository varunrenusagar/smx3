WELCOME TO THE SERVICEMIX EXAMPLES
==================================

Camel Examples
==============

- camel-osgi
  Deploys a Camel EIP route as an OSGi bundle. Configuration makes use
  of the OSGi Configuration Admin service and Spring property placeholders,
  and the example demonstrates how to deploy the properties file from the
  ServiceMix console.

- camel-blueprint
  Deploys a Camel EIP route as an OSGi bundle. Configuration makes use
  of the OSGi Configuration Admin service and uses a Blueprint XML file to
  start the Camel routes.

CXF examples
============

- cxf-jaxrs
  Creates a RESTful JAX-RS web service using CXF and exposes it using
  the OSGi HTTP service.

- cxf-osgi
  Creates a web service using CXF and Spring-DM, and exposes it through
  the OSGi HTTP service.

- cxf-ws-addressing
  Uses CXF to create a web service enabled for WS-Addressing, and exposes
  it through the OSGi HTTP service.

- cxf-ws-rm
  Uses CXF to create a web service enabled for WS-ReliableMessaging, and exposes
  it through the OSGi HTTP service.

- cxf-ws-security
  Uses CXF to create a web service enabled for WS-Security, and exposes
  it through the OSGi HTTP service.  It includes a custom CallbackHandler implementation
  to show you how to implement your own authentication logic.

ActiveMQ Examples
=================

- activemq-camel-blueprint
  Deploys Camel EIP routes as an OSGi bundle using Blueprint. These routes
  make use of an ActiveMQ queue hosted on the local broker deployed in ServiceMix.

Karaf examples
==============

- branding
  Builds the artifacts that allow you to re-brand Apache Karaf
  (as e.g. we did in Apache ServiceMix).

- dump
  Demo that deploys a simple service into the OSGi Service Registry
  using a Blueprint XML file.

- web
  Embeds Apache Karaf in a web application.


Prerequisites for Running the Examples
=========================================

Java Development Kit (JDK)
--------------------------
You must have JDK 1.6 or higher installed on your machine to
run the ServiceMix examples.

Apache Maven
------------
The examples use Apache Maven for building code. You must install
Maven 2.2.1 or higher and add the Maven bin/ directory to your PATH
if you want to build any of the examples. 

If you have not used Maven before, the first time you use it to
build one of the examples, it downloads a lot of JARs to a local
repository on your machine. The next time you run Maven it uses the
locally stored JARs where possible.

To download and find out more about Maven, visit:
  http://maven.apache.org

ServiceMix Container
--------------------
You must have ServiceMix up and running. To start the ServiceMix
container, run the following command:

  <servicemix_home>/bin/servicemix          (on UNIX)
  <servicemix_home>\bin\servicemix          (on Windows)


ServiceMix Features Facility
============================
Several of the examples make use of the ServiceMix features facility.
A feature is a named, versioned collection of OSGi bundles that work
together to provide some functionality. The details of what makes up
a feature are contained in a features definition file. The ServiceMix
console includes a features subshell that provides commands to enable
you to add and remove features, and to point to feature repositories.
If you add a feature, ServiceMix uses the details provided in
the features definition file to load and activate all of the
required bundles that are not already present in the container.

ServiceMix includes a number of features that make the running of
the examples quick and easy. Each feature enables you to use a single
command to install the example bundle and any bundles that the example
depends on.

To view a list of the features that are already installed, enter
the following command in the ServiceMix console:

  features:list

To view a list of the features that are used by the examples, enter
the following command in the ServiceMix console:

  features:list | grep examples

To view the repository URLs currently associated with the features
facility, enter the following command in the ServiceMix console:

  features:listUrl

To view the contents of the features definition file that includes
definitions for each of the features used by the examples, enter the
following command in the ServiceMix console:

  cat mvn:org.apache.servicemix/apache-servicemix/4.5.3/xml/features

For more information about the features facility, see the ServiceMix
documentation.
